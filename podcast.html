                    <p class="author"> Author:Jan Mackovic 40 min Read</p>
                    <p>Podcasts are very à la mode these days, which means you can find at least one covering just about any subject imaginable. Luckily, that includes learning French.
                    <p>Let’s look at the pros and cons of some of the best French learning podcasts.  And since English isn’t the only language podcasts come in, we’ll also check out some French podcasts that advanced learners and fluent speakers may want to give a listen.</p>

                        <h2>1. What to know about French podcasts</h2>
                        <p>Before we get started, here are some things to keep in mind about French learning podcasts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Listening skills are a critical part of becoming fluent in French.</strong> According to a study by PhD graduate Paul Sulzberger from Victoria University, “Neural tissue required to learn and understand a new language will develop automatically from simple exposure to the language – which is how babies learn their first language.” </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong> A big advantage of podcasts (as opposed to text or videos) is that you can listen to them just about anywhere on your mobile device or computer.</strong> This means that they’re a great way to practice French while you’re, say, driving to work, doing chores around the house, or taking a walk. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Some French learning podcasts are actually audio recordings of lessons from a learning platform, or an audio recording of a video, and they’re usually scripted, which means some kind of text version (usually a transcript) is available.</strong> The good news is, if you’re not a podcast person but you do like the subjects that are covered in a French learning podcast, chances are you can find the same thing in a different format. The bad news is that you can’t go into a French learning podcast expecting amazing production values and pacing – although some of them are extremely well produced, and all of the ones on our list are easy to hear and understand.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong> French learning podcasts aren’t the only way you should be learning French.</strong> It’s important to have some kind of visual and hands-on elements of language learning — not to mention a way to get a handle on things like grammar, a topic that isn’t often covered, or isn’t covered in depth, in French learning podcasts. You also can’t listen to a podcast one time and expect that you’ve acquired the vocabulary or whatever else was covered, forever. Just like anything else, you’ll have to review and practice regularly.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong> French learning podcasts won’t work for everyone. </strong> Some French learning podcasts may not work for the way you like to learn. For example, if you’re a visual learner, hearing vocabulary words repeated at you with no indication of how they’re written may not be very helpful (although once you’ve learned the vocabulary from a list and/or by writing it, you could use podcasts like this to help you with pronunciation). </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Not all French learning podcasts are reliable sources of correct French.</strong> After all, anyone can make a podcast. You could end up listening to one with a non-native speaker who uses words incorrectly or has a bad French accent. The ones on our list won’t have those problems, but if you come across a French learning podcast on your own, be careful. Try to find out about the native language and  teaching qualifications of the host(s). You can usually do this by visiting the “about” section of the podcast’s website.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you don’t know what kind of language learner you are, give podcasts a try – but remember to always supplement them with a visual element and other ways to practice.</p>
                        <p>Try thinking of them as a way to train your ear and/or as a supplement your classes at school or online.</p>

                        <p>Like just about any podcast. French podcasts can usually be found via their official site, as well as platforms like Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Player FM, etc.</p>
                        <p>French learning podcasts use different strategies. Some are entirely or mostly in French, while others are primarily in English. Some use regular spoken French, while others use slow French. </p>
                        <p>Slow French is what it sounds like – slower spoken French, which is a great way for beginners and intermediate level learners to practice their listening skills.</p>
                        <p>But it’s also important to listen to things in regular spoken French as well, so that you’ll be able to understand French speakers in everyday life – not to mention French movies, shows, and even other French podcasts.</p>
                        <p>French Together founder Benjamin wrote this helpful <a href="https://frenchtogether.com/slow-french/" class="yellow">article</a>  about the pros and cons of slow French,  and how you can turn audio into slow French if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Most French learning podcasts are tied to a learning platform, so you will probably hear ads or feel that you need to become a (usually paying) subscriber in order to access supplemental features. </p>
                        <p>Some French learning podcasts are free – including transcripts of the episodes. Others are free to listen to, but you have to subscribe or pay for access to a transcript and/or vocabulary list. Still others can only be accessed by paying for them. These are typically podcasts and audio that go with learning platforms.</p>

                          <h3><a href="https://frenchtogether.com/out/frenchpod101" class="yellow">3.1 Frenchpod 101</a></h3>
                          <p>Frenchpod101 used to be free, and according to its website’s FAQ, it still is…sort of. If you sign up, you have access to podcasts and lessons for a limited time, until they become part of the paying service.</p>
                          <p>Beginner level audio/podcasts are usually a spoken list of vocabulary, first in French, then in English. More advanced levels are like typical dialogues or podcasts.  Some of the audio options come with free transcripts or vocabulary lists, while others only make these available to paying members.</p>
                          <p>When he discovered the Frenchpod101 podcast a few years ago, French Together founder Benjamin Houy really loved it and thought that it was an excellent resource. Personally, I find it hard to locate the podcasts on their site, and when using a podcast site like Player FM, I’ve found that most of the options are actually just ads for Frenchpod101, not podcasts unto themselves.  It seems to me that a lot’s changed.</p>
                          <p>I would say that if you don’t mind paying for access to these podcasts, they could be helpful, but with so many other free options (as you’ll see from the rest of this list), they didn’t particularly stand out to me as being so remarkable as to be worth the investment.  But if you like the Frenchpod101 system and would sign up for the lessons anyway, the podcasts are a nice part of that.</p>
                          <p>Cost: $60-$316 USD a year, depending on your subscription level.  You may see that you can sign up for a free 7-day trial, but as with any subscription, be sure that you know how to cancel it if you don’t want to continue, so that you won’t be billed.</p>

                            <p>Basically, this podcast is what it says: different headlines are read in slow French. This means  a huge variety of vocabulary for listeners. </p>
                            <p>You can find some free episodes if you do an online search for “News in Slow French podcast.” These seem to only be advanced-level episodes, however.</p>
                            <p>The other levels, as well as all of the podcasts, not just selected episodes, are available via paid subscription. Personally, the free episodes I’ve listened to  show that the headlines seem to be well selected and enjoyably presented, so if you are planning to invest in a paid podcast subscription, this could be a good choice.</p>
                            <p>Cost: $19.99 USD a month ($239.88 USD per year) for access to the podcasts (different levels available) and other learning material.</p>
                            <p>If you’re on a budget, not to worry! There are many excellent free French learning podcasts. Here are some of the most notable, with our thoughts. </p>

                        <p>This cheerful, charming French podcast is hosted by Mark, a Scottish man who teaches French.</p>
                        <p>The lessons are helpful and feel very interactive and warm. For example, when Mark suggests holding your nose to practice the nasal sound of Non, he then remarks that he’s imagining people all around the world holding their noses right now. These sort of little side comments make for a fun and relaxed ambiance.</p>
                        <p>There are Coffee Break French podcasts for several levels of French learners, from “Absolute beginners” to “Advanced” and all of them are free and easily accessed from the website. Just scroll down the website’s main page and click on the “More Info” box for your level.   </p>
                        <p>The levels seem well thought-out. “Absolute beginners” podcasts involve basic vocabulary and slow speaking, and feature Mark and a beginner French student.</p>
                        <p>The “Advanced” ones are quite advanced, indeed, spoken at slightly slower speed than usual (but then again, the idea of the podcast I was listening to was that the speaker was reading an email, not having a real-time conversation), but not really anything much different from what I might hear in Paris every day.</p>
                        <p>The advanced courses include a native French speaker, who does most of the talking/reading.</p>
                        <p>But even if Mark’s speaking French, don’t worry – as French Together founder (and bona fide French guy) Benjamin Houy wrote in a previous article about this, Mark’s French accent is great (I am insanely jealous), so beginners are in good hands. </p>
                        <p>Cost: The podcasts are free and there is a course you can pay for, as well.</p>

                        <p>This podcast features different formats for different levels. Beginner level podcasts feature native speakers’ words explained by a native English speaker after the dialogue or information is said in French, while Advanced level podcasts are entirely in French, with vocabulary explained in French, by a native French speaker. </p>
                        <p>There are three levels, and a very wide range of topics are covered.</p>
                        <p>The weird thing is, despite the podcast’s very clear name, their website makes it hard to find podcasts for particular levels, and often calls podcasts by other names, like “lessons” and “guides”.</p>
                        <p>The only way I’ve found to locate lessons for  a particular level is to click on a podcast on the homepage at random listed under “Recent Lessons” and then look for the sidebar on the right that lets you choose between Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.</p>
                        <p>Another downside is that the beginner episodes seem somewhat advanced, to me. For example, this episode about how to use Ça va and talk about how you are involves a dialogue where a person is interrupted by their cell phone ringing and incorporates far more than basic vocabulary. All of that is explained by an English speaker afterward but to me it seems like it could feel like overload for a lot of beginner-level learners, especially absolute beginners.  </p>
                        <p>It seems like this podcast is best for intermediate or advanced French learners, who don’t mind sifting through lessons in order to find what they’re looking for, rather than relying on a more organized way to find it in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Cost: The podcasts are free, but the lesson guide for each has to be purchased.</p>

                        <p>Alexa is an experienced French teacher (and native French speaker). Her podcasts are positive but very teacherlike, asking people to repeat, guiding listeners, and announcing what you’ll learn later. </p>
                        <p>If this academic style appeals to you, great news: Alexa offers courses for three different French levels on her website – Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.</p>
                        <p>A paid subscription includes not only access to podcasts but worksheets and other helpful resources.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if you just want to listen to the podcasts without subscribing or paying for anything, your choices are more limited.</p>
                        <p>ou can find beginner-level podcasts she posted as long as ten years ago on sites like Player FM  and Apple Podcasts, but there are only 15 of these. Still, they provide a great introduction and should be a more than helpful way of determining if you want to go further into learning French with Alexa.</p>
                        <p>Cost: About 15 podcasts are free (available on third-party sites (links above), but you’ll have to pay for additional podcasts, as well as lessons and learning materials.</p>
